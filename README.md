# Steam Cache System
This is a simple class I wrote some years ago to cache Steam user data locally using the Steam Web API. It allows you to store and update user information based on their Steamid64.

## ⚡️ Test it
To test the class, clone the repository and copy the `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory, and then:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```

## 🤔 Usage
Simply remove the last two lines in `main.py` and import the class in your project.

## 📖 Additional information
This class was done as part of an integration on a dashboard I've made some years ago, which is not publicly available. Any improvements or suggestions are welcome!
